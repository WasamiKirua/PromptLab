  "subject_and_pose": "A photorealistic portrait of a beautiful young Japanese woman with platinum blonde hair and an athletic full hourglass figure, dressed as Lucy from Cyberpunk Edgerunners. She has a short, angled bob hairstyle featuring platinum blonde hair. Her expression is alluring yet calm, looking back over her shoulder directly at the viewer with dark almond-shaped eyes. She is posed leaning back against a wall in a three-quarter turn, with her right hand gently raised near her shoulder and her left arm relaxed by her side.",
  "outfit": "She is wearing a high-tech cyberpunk ensemble featuring a cropped white bolero-style jacket with voluminous sleeves and a high collar with red interior accents. Underneath is a tight, black, high-cut bodysuit made of a leather-like material that exposes the hips. The lower body features distinctive white cut-out thigh guards or chaps connected by black straps, worn over bare skin, transitioning into sleek black thigh-high boots.",
  "environment": "The background consists of a corner in a futuristic room with textured walls composed of white hexagonal tiles. To the left, a glass or acrylic fixture is visible on the wall. The setting evokes a clean, sci-fi interior or a cyberpunk apartment aesthetic.",
  "lighting_and_shot": "The lighting is cinematic and neon-noir, dominated by cool tones. A bright cyan-blue light source illuminates the subject from the upper left, creating strong highlights on the hair and jacket. The rest of the scene is bathed in a soft, ambient purple and magenta glow, reflecting off the hexagonal tiles. The shot is a vertical medium shot captured from a slightly low angle, focusing on the subject's profile and outfit details with high contrast and smooth textures. --ar 3:4"
